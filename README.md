MeterReader+

Developing a MeterReader+ (A CLoud Based Solution)

It is an innovative application designed to simplify the process of collecting, managing, and analyzing utility meter readings.

Leveraging the power of AWS services such as RDS, Lambda, and API Gateway, MeterReader+ ensures scalability, efficiency, and security while providing users with seamless access to their data.

This project is a migration of the original MeterReader app, which was built using PocketBase, to a more robust and scalable AWS infrastructure. Ref! - https://github.com/KalpanaInTech/Meter-Reader
